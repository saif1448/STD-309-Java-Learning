## Static Variable and Methods

- static is indicating related to the class level
- it means if you have something static, you don't need an object to access that
- you can access that method or variable via the class
- and all the objects of the class will share the same static variable and method
- if an object is static, the lifetime will be from the beginning to the end of the program

- you cannot pass  or use a nonstatic variable to a static method
- you cannot call a non static method from a static method. BUT, you can call a static from non static method
- If an object in a static context, you can access that object from static method. if that static context object calls or uses non static method or variable, it will not matter


## Object Passing in method

- When you take an object in the method parameter, you pass a reference of that object
- Object reference means the address of that object
- If you change something with that reference, it is gonna effect the original one as well
