## To Remember

- It is data structure
- It puts the data in sequential manner
- Because of this we can index over the array
- In Java, we put similar types of data inside an array
- an array is always of fixed size


## Complexities

- We have 2 types of resources we use
    - Time
    - Space
- We mostly focus on time
- For expressing time complexity we use different algorithmic notations
    - Big O ---> O() -----> Maximum how much time an algorithm is taking
    - Big Omega ---> Ω() ----> Minimum how much time an algorithm takes
    - Big Theta ---> Θ()  ----> Bounding in between the minimum and maximum time
    - Small O  ---> o()
    - Small omega ---->
    - Small Theta ---->
- We mainly focus to find out the O() complexity
- Comparing Complexities
    - O(n)
    - O(logn)
    - O(nLogn)
    - O(n^2)
    - O(1) ----> This is our optimal target
    - O(2^n)
    - O(n^3)
- O(1), O(logn), O(n), O(nlogn), O(n^2), O(n^3), O(2^N)

## Algorithms

- Finding the minimum and maximum
    - How to return an array from the function / method
    - How to return multiple values from a method / function
- Linear Search
    - How to pass an array to a function/method
    - Complexity ---> O(n)
