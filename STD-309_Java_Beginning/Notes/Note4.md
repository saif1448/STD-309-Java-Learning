## Main topics today

- Package and structure

- for usual case, there will be many classes but there will be only one main class which will have the main method
- we have to create files under the #src folder
- we call the folders as package in java
- Later packaging system will be explained in details after introducing OOP

- If .. else
  ```
  if(condition){
  
  }

  if(condition){
  }else{
  }

  ```
    - Conditional Chaining
        - We are gonna use logical operators like && ||  for conditional chaining
    - Nested if else
        - we are gonna put one if..else into another
    - if else ladder
        - after the first condition in the if, we are gonna provide other conditions in the else if()
        - last else statement is not mandatory
```
	if(condition_1){
	
	}else if(condition_2){
	
	}else if(condition_3){
	
	}else{
	}
```

# Task for if else
- Write a program to determine if a year is a leap year

- switch case
    - it is similar to else if ladder
    - but it only checks one condition
        - == condition
```
	switch(the_variable_to_equal_match){
		case equal_match_1:
			break;
		case equal_match_2:
			break:
		case equal_match_3:
			break:
		default:
			
	}
```

## Task 2
- Convert the else if ladder program to switch case

- loop
    - for loop
    - while loop
    - do while
    - extended for loop
    -
- break
- continue
- var key word
